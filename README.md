# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analysis project showcasing Customer Behavior Analysis using Python, SQl and Power BI.


1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data processing to business insights visualization. The objective was to clean, analyze, and transform the dataset into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The project covers:

Data loading and preprocessing in Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI

Business report generation

Presentation (PPT) creation using Gamma

This project reflects real-world analytics practices used in data-driven organizations.



2. Dataset

Standardized categorical values

Converted data types where required

Created new derived features for better insights

Step 4: SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Group-based analysis

Filtering & sorting

Joins (if multiple tables)

Subqueries and window functions (if applicable)

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to SQL database

Created interactive visualizations

Designed KPI cards, charts, filters, and slicers

Built a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders

Step 6: Reporting & Presentation

Documented findings in a structured report

Highlighted business insights and recommendations

Created a professional PPT using Gamma




5. Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

📈 Sales/Revenue Trends

📊 Category-wise Performance

🌍 Region-wise Analysis

🧮 KPI Metrics (Total Sales, Profit, Growth %)

🎛 Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

The dashboard is designed for decision-makers to quickly understand performance metrics and trends.





6. Results & Insights

Key outcomes from the analysis:

Identified top-performing categories and regions

Discovered seasonal or time-based trends

Highlighted underperforming segments
