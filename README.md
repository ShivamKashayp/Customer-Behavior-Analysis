# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analysis project showcasing Customer Behavior Analysis using Python, SQl and Power BI.


<h1>1. Overview</h1>

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data processing to business insights visualization. The objective was to clean, analyze, and transform the dataset into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The project covers:

Data loading and preprocessing in Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI

Business report generation

Presentation (PPT) creation using Gamma

This project reflects real-world analytics practices used in data-driven organizations.



<h1>2. Dataset</h1>

Type: Structured dataset (CSV format)

Content: Contains business-related records such as customer data, transactions, sales, or operational metrics

<h1>5. Project Steps</h1><br>
Step 1: Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked data types, structure, and summary statistics<br>

<h2>Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

Identified missing values and outliers

Analyzed distributions of key variables

Created visualizations for trends and patterns

Performed correlation analysis<br>

<h2>Step 3: Data Cleaning</h2>

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized categorical values

Converted data types where required

Created new derived features for better insights<br>

<h2>Step 4: SQL Analysis</h2>

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Group-based analysis

Filtering & sorting

Joins (if multiple tables)

Subqueries and window functions (if applicable)<br>

<h2>Step 5: Power BI Dashboard</h2>

Connected Power BI to SQL database

Created interactive visualizations

Designed KPI cards, charts, filters, and slicers

Built a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders<br>

<h2>Step 6: Reporting & Presentation</h2>

Documented findings in a structured report

Highlighted business insights and recommendations

Created a professional PPT using Gamma<br>




<h1>5. Dashboard Highlights</h1>

The Power BI dashboard includes:
